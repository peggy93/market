								<h4>Can you pump my token to the moon?</h4>
								<p>
								The price of an asset is simply defined by supply and demand. In the case of utility tokens, Demand is usually created by the utility of the asset. Historically speaking, "pumping" token prices are not a sustainable effort. We can only facilitate and accelerate organic growth, but in the end, your project needs to have a vibrant community that is willing to buy the tokens.
